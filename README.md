If you're posting a bug, try to include a screenshot, but definitely include info on the resolution you run TF2 in, whether you run MinMode, and any other settings or scripts you have set up. If you have fixes, link to the relevant file line on GitHub, or a commit line. Or just submit a pull request. That works too.
