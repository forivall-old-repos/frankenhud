FRANKENHUD RELEASE 51
---------------------
For Team Fortress 2 by Valve.

INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS - READ THIS, SERIOUSLY
-------------------------------------------
Windows Users:
Open this zip file in your extraction program of choice. I personally use 7zip. If you don't have one, Windows Explorer should work fine.
Open the "HUD" folder in the zip file.
Move the contents of this folder (not the folder itself!) to steam\steamapps\[your account]\team fortress 2\tf

Mac OS X (thanks Braden!):
Double click the zip file in Finder to extract the contents to a folder.
Open the "HUD" folder inside this folder.
Copy the contents of this folder (not the folder itself!) to user/Library/Application Support/Steam/SteamApps/[your account]/team fortress 2/tf/

Linux:
I honestly don't know. If you're in the Linux Steam beta, let me know! My email's at the bottom of the readme, as always.

Extras Files:
Extras are installed in much the same way as the main HUD. Check the readme files in their respective folders to get the details.

Run TF2, exhale, wash your hands.

! ! ! IF THE DAMAGE AND TIMER NUMBERS ARE INVISIBLE, THEN YOU DIDN'T FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS CORRECTLY AND I WILL IGNORE YOU IF YOU TRY TO REPORT IT BECAUSE I'LL KNOW YOU DIDN'T READ THIS FILE. SERIOUSLY, DON'T DO THIS. TRY AGAIN. MAKE SURE THERE'S A CLIENTSCHEME.RES FILE IN YOUR RESOURCE FOLDER. IF THERE ISN'T, YOU SCREWED UP ! ! !

If you see no differences, then check your TF folder for a "HUD" folder and move the files within to your TF folder. Then check yourself in for English classes.

UNINSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------
Go to the above-mentioned TF folder, and delete the resource and script folders. Don't worry, Steam is smart and powered by science, and will cheerfully restore the default TF2 files.

CHANGELOG
---------
Release 51 - Merry Whatever (20/12/12)
- HOPEFULLY updated for the Mecha Update!
- Tweaked the Status panel in MvM. Now the wave name should look right even on Wave 666. Only, what, four months late!
- Enabled text wrapping on the "Winning Capture: ..." label in the victory box.
- Added styling to the Spy's MvM Sapper recharge meter
- Fixed the loadout buttons in the Quick-Switch menu.
- Shoved the Respawn timer above the TargetID to avoid getting covered up on 3CP maps.
- Removed the annoying grey box in non-minimalhud spectator mode! Finally!
- Subtly adjusted install instructions in the readme to account for the majority of BS bug reports by the criminally illiterate.

RELEASE 50 - THE BIG FIVE-OH EDITION (5/12/12)
Jesus, have I really been doing this for two and a half years?
- Added some Big Picture support! Some things aren't as good as I would prefer (the Class Select in paticular), but Engie and Spy menus work great thanks to earlier work back in Release 33. Thanks to FlaminSarge for the help!
- I, uh, I probably should have had something cooler ready for Version 50, huh.
- Oh well. Live and learn, I guess.

Release 49 - No Whammies Edition (1/11/12)
- Fixed the Wheel of Fate display.

Release 48 - Lunch Break Edition (27/10/2012)
- Added support for Scream Fortress 4.
- This is pretty much completely untested - I just copied over the changes from the Wiki's patch diff. As a result, the Wheel of Doom HUD stuff might be placed weirdly.

Release 47 - The Biggest Update Ever Edition (24/09/2012)
- Added the "credits still in-world" MvM HUD element. WOW.

Release 46 - Remember To Breathe Edition (19/08/2012)
- Fixed the Spy disguise panel's health display being too high up
- Subtle adjustment to the ammo icon when healing a teammate in MvM
- Fixed the Classic Death Notices extra
- Included Valve's default Tournament Setup files for the people who don't understand what "DELETE ANY CURRENT FRANKENHUD INSTALLATION BEFORE INSTALLING" means.
- Seriously, you guys, sometimes I wonder.

Release 45 - Scars Edition (17/08/2012)
- Restyled the Buyback feature to fit with the FrankenHUD respawn timer
- Fixed the respawn timer breaking outside of MvM
- Resstyled the item meter for the Powerup Canteen
- Fixed giant bot health counter in MvM by reverting an awful hacky thing from 36 releases ago(!) from the Target ID
- Fixed a bug where the game would crash upon killcam if you were dominated
- Fixed the "Select a Class" text on the MvM class select getting cut off
- Moved the "upgraded class" icons on the MvM class select to their proper locations

Release 44 - 100011 Edition (16/08/2012)
DELETE ANY CURRENT FRANKENHUD INSTALLATION BEFORE INSTALLING TO ENSURE THAT NOTHING GETS CAUGHT IN THE BLADES
- Added preliminary support for Mann Vs. Machine! SOME THINGS WILL LOOK TERRIBLE. I HAVE YET TO FIX THEM.
- Shifted around the order of some things in HudLayout to match the official HudLayout order for the sake of my sanity
- Added some HudLayout stuff that had somehow fallen through the cracks over the years
- Fixed a few tiny things relating to Special Delivery mode
- This update is brought to you by Sublime Text 2's splitscreen mode, and by TF Wiki not uploading the diffs that would have made my life infinitely easier. Way to be, team!

Release 43 - Top of the World, Ma! Edition (3/08/2012)
- Added Highlander elements to Team Select.
- Added item meter for the Flying Guillotine.
- Updated readme contact details.

Welcome back, old friend. I was gone for a bit, but things are better now.
- Redid the Main Menu to better fit Valve's precarious, constantly changing preferences.
- Subtly shifted the bottom menu buttons to the left so as to actually be centered instead of slightly biased to the right
- Shoved the "Crit Counter" Item Meter to the side a bit further, so as to avoid overlapping the Pyro's Mmmph meter when using the Grodbort set.
- Updated to fit the Pyromania update! There might still be some issues, though, I haven't exactly tested thoroughly.

Release 41 - Back To Kirkland Edition (16/12/2011)

-The backpack icon greys out nicely instead of just vanishing when Random or Cancel are highlighted.
-Keyboard shortcuts are re-enabled.
-Lowered the size of the player count numbers, to accomodate the "(MAX #)/(FULL)" label when Class Limits are on. Thanks CraigK for pointing this out!
-Minor tweaks to element positioning that aren't really worth mentioning.

And in the "other crap" catergory...

Release 37 - Sticky Jumped Edition (16/09/2011)
- Damage popups from healing teammates are now the right colour.

Release 36 - 240 Pages Of Badposting Edition (7/09/2011)
- Changed the Strange item colour to match the latest patch.
- Made the Extras folder a zip, to see if that helps with possible issues caused by OSX's default unzipper.

Release 33 - Spring Cleaning Edition (1/08/2011)
- Moved the Bazaar Bargain's head count so as to not overlap the other Item Effect Meters.

- Rewrote the readme's install instructions. Hopefully these will be easier to understand!

Release 32 - Pigs In Space Edition (21/07/2011)
- Added meters for the Soldier's new WETA/Comiccon weapons. Pew! Pew!

Release 31 - Oopsie Edition (16/07/11)
- Fixed the Bazaar Bargain's head count being a meter and not a counter. I think. I don't actually have one to test with.

- Changed the TF2 Advanced Options button icon to something a little more fitting.

- Fixed outdated parts of the readme file.

Release 29 - HEAL NO HALOS Edition (25/06/11)
- Fixed the new ItemEffectMeters. Forgot to include them in the last release, DOY.
- Tweaked the new Main Menu a bit to match the restyled lower buttons from Release 27.
- Caused a violent community uproar that'll be forgotten in a week. Again. Must be nearly July.

Release 28 - Free As In Hats Edition (24/06/11)
...I should have saved that name for when the Linux port eventually arrived.
- Updated to work with the Uber Update! ... The Über Update. The Euber Update?
- Removed the Alt. Load Screen extra.
YOU SHOULD UNINSTALL PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF FRANKENHUD BEFORE PROCEEDING TO ENSURE THAT NOTHING GETS CAUGHT IN THE BLADES AND CATCHES ALIGHT

Release 27 - Abrupt Edition (5/20/11)
- Restyled the main menu lower buttons to add the new Advanced Options menu.

Release 25 - Countdown To The Countdown Edition (4/16/11)
- Fixed a bug where getting a new item crashed the game.

Release 24 - Hot Hot CExLabel Edition (4/15/11)

- Started re-doing the main menu. Since it currently looks fine on all resolutions, I've removed the 4:3 resolution fix.
- Made the Trading chat font the same as the normal chat font. Which is to say, it isn't hilariously tiny anymore.
- You know what sucks? Finding a crash just as you're about to release.

Release 23 - The Quick Fix Edition (3/11/11)
- Updated the Health element to support the new "Marked for Death" status effect.
- Fixed the colours on "Genuine" promo weapons (Thanks, Zoolooman!)
- Updated the Quick-Switch menu to have the scrollbar visible, to reduce confusion.
- Added a new extra - an alternate Quick-Switch Menu.

- Fixed for the HOM patch.

Release 20 - Ye Bugfixe Edition (12/18/10)

Release 19 - So Wild International Edition (12/3/10)
- Made more text use localization translations for better non-English FrankenHUD use.
- Little cleanups and improvements here and there.
- Fixed the Simple Spy Disguise menu.

Release 18 - Poetry Edition (11/24/10)
- Removed the classic taskbar icon, since Valve basically incorporated the exact same thing officially.
- Added MORE DROP SHADOWS!!! to the item descriptions.
- Made the "Level # Weapon Name" text brighter to be more legible.
- Removed the "Playername is Carrying..." text from the freezecam and spectator versions of the inspection panel, because it wasn't saying anything you couldn't see elsewhere on the screen, and was often overlapped by the item image.
- Made the "Press F5 to capture this moment!" element in Freezecam smaller and less annoying.
- Adjusted the Item Pickup Panel to look nicer. A bit.
- Made a Steam Community group for quicker update announcements! http://steamcommunity.com/groups/frankenhud/

Release 17 - Should Have Been Delayed A Year Edition (11/11/10)
NOTE: I RECOMMEND A CLEAN INSTALL! Uninstall the old version first for maximum pleasure.
- Fixed cart outlines? I think? I'm only just seeing them now, and I added a missing HudLayout element, so... Thanks m2pt5!
- Tweaks and fixes to the scoreboard by Blackbird88. Props to him!
- Moved the background and game load changes from the last update to a separate extra.
- Added DROOOOOP SHADOOOOOOOOWS to the map load screen. Also adjusted some values on the righthand box to make it a better size.
- Added several extras for Windows taskbar icons and classic death notices.
- Played around with the Build, Destroy and Disguise menus. The Disguise menu is much smaller and placed more out of the way now.
- Actually added various past fixes that somehow never reached the ZIP file. Durr!

Release 16 - You'll Never Work In This Town Again Edition (11/3/10)
- Fixed the "X Team Seizes Area!" text on the Winpanel on TC/multistage CP maps being too low.
- Updated the Main Menu to use the weird new background system.
- Updated the 4:3 Main Menu to be the same as it's widescreen equivelant.
- Changed the game-load background to the Xbox 360 game-load background. Beta-tacular!
- Reskinned the map-load screen!

Release 15 - Imminent Electromechanical Failure Edition (10/23/10)
Not even a hard drive failure can stop me! At least, not for longer than a day or two.
- Fixed the Demoman charge bar using the old widescreen alignments instead of the nice universal ones.
- Fixed chat in trades being invisible (but if you don't like small text, than HOO BOY!)
- Speaking of which, there's now an optional "large text" file for in-game chat in the TF2-Style Fonts extra that uses the Xbox 360 font sizes.
- Fixed lazy/bad text alignment on server time limit in the scoreboard.
- Added an extra that removes the item box from the freezecam.
- More fixes will come once I've set everything back up.

Release 14 - Renovations Edition (10/17/10)
- Reverted the freezecam boxes, the ones in Release 12 were, let's face it, kind of crap and had bugs I just couldn't fix. Also, I had somehow revived the broken item box from the pre-Mannconomy update. Gotta love my awful version control!
- Fixed crits not appearing in the damage numbers, and gave damage numbers their own font definitions for added flexibility.
- Changes and updates to the TF2-style font definitions. Mostly adding antialiasing to stuff that didn't have it and needed it.
- Added the missing Milkdrop element to the Health meter.
- Repaired the Tournament Spectator stuff a bit. Might need more love. Tell me if it does.
- Betterified the WinPanels. That's a very technical term, I know.

Release 13 - Oops Edition (10/13/10)
- Fixed the accidental deletion of the freezecam item box.
- Fixed the forced installation of the TF-style fonts.

Release 12 - One Size Fits All Edition (10/12/10)
- Redid all the element positioning to be far more resolution-agnostic! Now the Main Menu's the only thing that needs a non-widescreen version. This is a pretty awesome thing as it makes FrankenHUD way more compatible with other resolutions, and thus easier to maintain!
- Reimplemented the Inspect panel, which I had deliberately broken at some point for some reason I can't really remember.
- Included the optional TF-style SourceScheme as an Extra, instead of as a forgotten mod on FPSB!
- Some fiddling to the Quick Item Switch menu.
- Nicer Nemesis icon and smaller freezecam screenshot popup. Also removed all the unnecessary XBox 360 definitions from the freezecam panel because hey, why the hell not.
- Increased the width of the large player name on the scoreboard.

Release 11 - Macrotransaction Edition (10/9/10)
- Shrunk down the Payload HUD again. 4:3 players shouldn't have any trouble with it sitting over the top of their health any more.
- Updated to work with the new update.
- Updated the scoreboard to properly incorporate the Duelling scoreboard.
- Slight retouches to the new HealthAccount thing.
- Adjustments and improvements to the voice chat IDs, again taken and tweaked from CS Source.
- M0re-style obituaries. Still not 100% sure about these. Please send feedback.
- The customised Item Pickup Panel is BACK, baby! Thanks to some horrible, HORRIBLE hackiness (http://tinyurl.com/26bmy25) for ease of previewing.

Release 10 - Both Hands Edition (7/21/10)
- Revamped the "You Did Better At This Than Your Personal Best" window.
- Fixed various placement errors in Non-Widescreen mode.
- Fixed the missing health in the Disguise HUD.
- Updated the Payload HUD to support the hills in the new maps.
- Updated the scoreboard to support really long team names, as ESEA players apparently tend to use. Winpanels still look pug-ugly, though.
- Tweaked the Arena Winpanel to better fit the "Capture By:" caption.
- Barring some major issue cropping up, this is probably going to be the last release for a while. At least, until the Polycount pack breaks everything.

Release 9 - In Which Kins Realises He Screwed Up Exactly Ten Minutes After Uploading Release 8... Edition (7/13/10)
- Moved the respawn timer so it isn't under the Spectator TargetID. Durr!
- Tried an experimental new HUD for Payload Race, in which there's only one bar shared by both teams. It's not perfect, but let me know what you think! (Thanks Jrock455 for planting this idea in my head)
- Added a drop-shadow to the Spectator tips so they're more legible with minmode 1.
- REMOVED that goddamn half-health icon at the top of the screen! This is a horrible horrible hacky workaround that I'm frankly ashamed of, but it works great.

Release 8 - Small Things Edition (7/12/10)
- Added Mac install instructions to the readme (cheers Braden!)
- TF-Style clientscheme now affects the FreezeCam item description text.
- Modified the Achievement Progress Tracker slightly. Now the "Best Little Slaughterhouse In Texas" achievement name won't suddenly cut off.
- Slightly widened the Engineer Revenge Crits counter so that text fits nicer on the standard font.
- Pushed the TargetID health to the left slightly to fix cutoff on the third digit.
- Adjusted the CTF and Spectator HUDs to stop overlapping of the respawn timer in One-Flag CTF and Payload Race.
- Pleases small minds. :v

Release 7 - New Toys Edition (7/10/10)
- Added Steam Community avatars to the voice chat IDs, ala the CS:Source update!
- Fixed up the TargetID health to look less awful
- Readded and altered the little "you can grab this" icon.
- Moved the TargetIDs lower.
- Properly FrankenHUD-ised the Engineer's new Revenge Crits counter.
- Fixed the Arena player count placement. It's back down the bottom now.
- Tweaked the Quick Switch panel. Now it fits all the Demo melee items without scrolling or cutoff.

Release 6 - BADUNK Edition (7/9/10)
- Ported to the latest version of TF2. Well, it works anyway. Some things might still need my special sauce.
- Minor bits of eye-candy for the Team Select.
- Fixed a bug on the class select menu where the Random button was actually the height of three buttons, blocking the Sniper button from use.
- Fixed a bug with the non-widescreen main menu on 1280x1024 resolution.
- Minor adjustments to the Timer and Damage numbers.
- NO cosmetic shiny baubles of no real significance. I've seen what you PEOPLE do when offered them. This is why we can't have nice things.
- Vast amounts of swearing when the Steam update automatically deleted several files I hadn't backed up. DAMMIT ASK ME BEFORE DOING THIS
- A big thanks to everyone who emailed, PMed and commented with bug reports and suggestions!

Release 5 - Coming Out Edition (7/4/10)
- Fixed some things for our 4:3 cousins.
- More main menu adjustments.
- Fixed the numbers popping up in the Team Select, prettied it up a little.
- Fixed the Arena Team Select's "spectate" button not working. Also prettied it up a little.
- Brand new Class Select menu! It's so cash.
- A faint sense of fear regarding how much the Engineer Update will break this.
- Actually showing this around the internet outside of Facepunch! We're LIVE, baby!

Release 4 - Droppin' It Edition
- More drop shadows. More! MORE! WHOO-AH-AH-AH-AH
- Adjusted the Arena Win Panel a little.
- Adjusted the scoreboard
- Fixed the titlescreen
- Moved stuff around in the Widescreen title screen.

Release 3 - Less Franken Edition
- Adjusted the damage display settings.
- Added new WinPanel for normal and Arena.
- Added new Scoreboard
- Added new Item Get screen
- Added new MOTD/Mapinfo screen
- Added new Arena objective display
- Added a modified version of TF2 Secondary for the TFStyle clientscheme
- Various little tweaks I forgot.

Release 2 - Shapes and Sizes Edition (13/06/10)
- Added alternate build for non-widescreen resolution.
- Made the Ubercharge Bar text less horrible (White with a black outline)

Release 1 - Potentially Buggy As All Get Out Edition (12/06/10)
- Initial Release

KNOWN BUGS
----------
Tournament HUD additions are largely untested. If anything's especially funky looking, please tell me.

HELP! HELP!
-----------
Q: TF2 updated, and now the HUD looks weird and broken!
A: Uninstall the HUD and check for a new version.

Q: Will this work on all resolutions?
A: It should! If you have a tiny, tiny screen resolution though, you should probably install the Classic Kill Notices extra.

Q: Why isn't everything bundled up next to the crosshair? I can't play TF2 unless everything consists of contextless, backgroundless numbers right next to my crosshair!
A: There are better huds for that sort of thing. You may also want to see a doctor about your tunnel vision!

Q: I don't like the new MOTD/Map info menu!
A: Delete MapInfoMenu.res, TextWindow.res and TextWindowCustomServer.res from tf/resource/ui. Sorted!

Q: There's no timer in Arena Mode!
A: Stop playing Prophunt.
